## Problem Statement
Booking apartments often involves complex calculations for pricing, preferences (like corner apartments), and different handling of payment modes. Real-estate agencies require automated, user-friendly systems to improve customer experience, reduce error, and standardize receipts and audit trails.

## Scope of the Project
The project allows users to book an apartment from available types, opt for special features (corner units), and pay via different methods. It automates billing logic, generates a unique token for every booking, and provides clear, conditional receipts. The system can be the basis for further expansion into web or mobile booking platforms.
